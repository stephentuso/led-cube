# led-cube

This was one of my first programming projects, my dad built a 5x5x5 single color led cube and connected it to an Arduino uno with a [centipede shield](http://docs.macetech.com/doku.php/centipede_shield). I wrote some functions to control the leds. A year later I refactored a little, added it to a git repo, and made it a library (I originally would copy/paste the functions into every script I wrote..)
